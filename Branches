import-policy-rollback-branch: a branch  (non working) I created since
I'm at an empass with service import poliy. I've lately thought that a
gateway should provide only one service for all it's peers and foreign
domains  that has  exported the  service  to the  gateway. This  would
negate the need to  have a entry in the IPC gateway  table for all but
local gateways.  and  shorten the service table. However,  in order to
avoid having to ask the mwgwd's for what GW we're connected to we need
all  the  entries in  the  gw  table.  (THis  was  the  plan from  the
outset). By having all the service/gateway relations in the IPC tables
we also have tha added benefit  of knowing to cost of each service. SO
right now I'm going with having an entry in the service table for each
serveice each  peer export.  We keep  this branch in  case we  want to
rollback to a policy change.
