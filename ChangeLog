2004-07-13  Terje Eggestad  <te@pc-16.office.scali.no>

	RELEASE 0.14.0

2004-07-12  Terje Eggestad  <te@pc-16.office.scali.no>

	* src/lib/mwserverapi.c (mwforward): mwforward was broken, service
	id and name was not updated in call message before forwarding.

2004-06-17  Terje Eggestad  <te@pc-16.office.scali.no>

	* src/lib/ipcmessages.c (_mw_ipcsend_event):
	  was broken, wrong handling of fromid parameter. 	

2004-06-16  Terje Eggestad  <te@pc-16.office.scali.no>

	* mwattach: If failed the lib was still in attached state, forcing
	a mwdetach() before a retry was possible. Now fixed.


2004-05-31  Terje Eggestad  <terje.eggestad@iname.com>

	* changes to internal API to allow language modules access to intenal API

	* Created struct to hold pointers to MW functions for a given
	protocol, a step towards building the lib with only a subset of
	protocols (like an tcp/ip only lib)

	
2004-04-13  Terje Eggestad  <terje.eggestad@iname.com>

	* mwd completely failed unprovide requests, fixed. Also the server
	name is not set propperly in the server table.

2004-04-12  Terje Eggestad  <terje.eggestad@iname.com>

	* mwsetcred() introduced, for setting authentication information
	like username, password, X509 certificates, and kerboeros
	information.  

	* mwattach() has a new prototype, username and password is
	moved to a new function: mwsetcred().

	* mwdetach() now return correct returncodes.  

	* mwgeturl() introduced to the the url we actually attached to.
	
2004-04-08  Terje Eggestad  <terje.eggestad@iname.com>

	* introduced a struct with pointers to the functions implementing
	the client midway functions for a given protocol (as in SRB, ipc,
	(+future http etc)).  This is in preparation for be able to do
	configure with/without spesific protocolst o build ipc only or
	srbp only libraries/distros. This creates a new internal API each
	protocol must addhere to.

2004-03-12  Terje Eggestad  <te@pc-16.office.scali.no>

	* added a mwevent client, a utility for posting events from commandline.  

2004-03-01  Terje Eggestad  <te@pc-16.office.scali.no>

	* change in mwfetch() params, handle is now a int pointer that
	will be set to the hdl for the reply retrived.

	* added event API for SRB clients

	clientname and authentication method

2004-02-20  Terje Eggestad  <te@pc-16.office.scali.no>

	neightbour discovery. Some ethernet switches either don't
	understand multicast or have multicasts disabled...

	* Fix in mwd for hang. When issuing events to subscribers, and a
	subscribers msgqueue was full, mwd you be in blocking in msgsnd().

2003-12-11  eggestad  <eggestad@pc-16.office.scali.no>

	* loglevel env vars now accept levels as a string

2003-08-07  Terje Eggestad  <terje.eggestad@iname.com>

	* There was a critical bug in client SRB buffering of incomming
	data, causing dropped messages. As a result the code in mwgwd and
	client is now much more merged. There are in the lib functions for
	reading/writeing to a connection (prep for TLS), parsing of an
	incomming SRB message (needed for inline binary data). 
	
2003-07-21  Terje Eggestad  <terje.eggestad@iname.com>

	* fixed major ipc buffers corruption bug when all buffers exausted
	* also make mwacall and mwreply retry for a while if no buffers are immediatly available
