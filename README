**** What is MidWay? ****

MidWay is a Service Request Broker. Not unlike an ORB (object Request
Broker), but a SRB works by function passing, not method passing,
there are no objects here in the sense OO describe it. An SRB are
state less while an ORB is statefull.

In a SRB a process (called a server) provides a service given by a
name. A client can now call the service and pass it input data, and it
returns data.  While commecial SRBs usually has some means to declare
data types, in MidWay "data" means an octet string, think Perl
scalars.

The providing of a service is a dynamic affair, no need for an
ORB'like IDL.  There are no limitation on how many servers that can
provide the same service.

This parallellism gives a lot of scalability. You can do both fan-out
and pipleline parallellism with MidWay. The purpose of a SRB is speed
and scalability. Speed comes from the statelessness. (Se docs for
details).  Building applications that can handle 100 hits a second is
simple.

SRB are traditionally called Transaction Processing Monitors or TP
monitors.  They earned that by providing transaction support, thus a
clients could after calling n services either commit or rollback the
work done in all the services.  This fuctionallyit is not implemeted
yet, and will only be if in demand.

MidWay is intended to be more WEB and internet orientated that its
commercial cousins. Really easy since most TP Monitors have mainframe
legacy in mind.



**** Running Midway ****

To do a quick test of MidWay, goto src and write make. There are no
installation as of yet, this is alpha code. Either greate a soft link
from /lib to src/lib/libMWipc.so, and do a ldconfig -v or include
$PWD/src/lib/ in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

goto src/mwd and start mwd by ./mwd -D, check
~/MidWay/userid/log/SYSTEM.date

goto src/lib and start testmidway

goto src/mwadm and start it, at prompt give the command: 
MWADM> call test1 date 
the test1 service in testmidway shall now give you the date.

Now read the docs!



**** A Note on Release Numbers. ****

In the CVS archive releasable versions are tagged with 
STABILITY_M_N_P which are:
STABILITY: Alpha, Beta, Release, and possibly more.
           Put simply it says what quality of code this is meant to be.
M: Is the major version number that indicate that there are major changes
   and most probably incompatibilities.
N: Minor version number, indicate new fetues, but no incompatibilities.
P: Patch number, bugs files only. 

The rationale for using the STABILITY verb is that many projects are
developing on 0.X.Y and releases on 1.0.0. Which is OK, but causes
confusion later on when say 2.3.24 is experimental, while 2.2.15 is
production.  Observant readers may recognice that this is Linux kernel
version numbers.  Linus & co seem to prefer 2.even.patch for
production, and 2.odd.patch for development. Not a bad plan either. I
just really want the three numbers to have the meaning as indicated
above, and the only way to indicate quality is to add a new indicator.
