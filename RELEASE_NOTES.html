0.13 is mainly a bugfix release, but it required quite significant
changes, see the Changelog. The API is unchanged.

0.13.1 is a bug fix that fixes one major bug, and that is that
sometimes multiple replies to a service call was returned in wrong
order.

0.13.2 is a bugfix release that fixes two full IPC msg queue
problems. mwd(1) would hang when attempting posting events to a full
queue, and mwreply() would drop replies when replying to a full queue.

There will be a change to mwfetch() in the next release. 
<p>

I haven't made a man page for the config so here is the corrently only doc of it. 

The config file is placed under ~/Midway/&ltuserid&gt/config. (For
info in how to change the place of this directory, see MidWay(7)). The
file has an XML format, and here is an example:

<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt
&lt;MidWay&gt
  &lt;mwd servers="20" clients="50"&gt
  &lt;Servers autoboot="yes"&gt
    &lt;group name="grp1" autoboot="yes"&gt
      &lt;server name="shell" autoboot="yes"&gt
        &lt;exec&gt;mwserver&lt/exec&gt
        &lt;arglist&gt;-s shell shell.so&lt/arglist&gt
        &lt;autorestart min="0" max="0" delay="5"/&gt
      &lt/server&gt
    &lt/group&gt
  &lt/Servers&gt
  &lt/mwd&gt

  &lt;mwgwd&gt
  &lt;env&gt
MWGWD_LOGLEVEL=debug
  &lt;/env&gt
   &lt;domain name="testdom"&gt
   &lt/domain&gt
  &lt/mwgwd&gt

&lt/MidWay&gt
</pre>

this config will tell mwd to do two things.
<br>
a) start a server with a service shell that
is implemented in a library shell.so. 
<br>
b) start a mwgwd in the domain testdom.
