There are quite significant changes in this release, the API however
is virtually unchanged. There are two major additions. 
<p>
1) is the mwd ability to manage servers. There is a config file, that
is placed under ~/Midway/&ltuserid&gt/config. (For info in how to change
the place of this directory, see MidWay(7)). The file has an XML
format, and here is an example:
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt
&lt;MidWay&gt
  &lt;mwd servers="20" clients="50"&gt
  &lt;Servers autoboot="yes"&gt
    &lt;group name="grp1" autoboot="yes"&gt
      &lt;server name="shell" autoboot="yes"&gt
        &lt;exec&gt;mwserver&lt/exec&gt
        &lt;arglist&gt;-s shell shell.so&lt/arglist&gt
        &lt;autorestart min="0" max="0" delay="5"/&gt
      &lt/server&gt
    &lt/group&gt
  &lt/Servers&gt
  &lt/mwd&gt

  &lt;mwgwd&gt
   &lt;domain name="testdom"&gt
   &lt/domain&gt
  &lt/mwgwd&gt

&lt/MidWay&gt
</pre>

this config will tell mwd to do two things.
<br>
a) start a server with a service shell that
is implemented in a library shell.so. 
<br>
b) start a mwgwd in the domain testdom. 
<p>
There will be an interface in mwadm to start and stop servers. 
<p>


2) The MidWay Gateway daemon (mwgwd) is now able to interconnect all
mwgwd in the same domain. This mean that a service available in one
instance will be available in other instances if they have mwgwd
running in the same domain. The mwgwd will route the service call to
the instance where the server is running. 

<p>
Documentation of new features are incomplete, most notably teh config
file format is undocumented, and will be extended beyond what is
described here.
<p>


* Configuration file for mwd
<p>
* the gateway daemon now interconnect instances in the same domain
<p>
* event partially work. They work inside a instance, but not distributed among the instances within a domain, which they shall. 
<p>
* quite a few bugfixes.
