 PARTIAL * SRBP (TCP/IP) clients and gateways between MW instances.
	 * missing large data
	 * and of course all event handling

     * native module ready

 * Python module

 * TCL bindings

     MINOR TODO LIST
=======================================================================

 * Staticstics

 * trace facility

 * SRB trace need better peer info. (_mw_srb_trace)

 * Data buffers are not arbitrary length

 * fast path missing

 * server mangement, Tuxedo style

 * config file (XML)

 * authentication in gateway. Requires config 

 * allow multiple replies to a service request. Solves the html
   problem, and simple to implement.

 * in doc, add refernce to pthreads programming ch3. THread pools p98

 * protocol version negotiation

 (OK) * if mwcall() or mwacall(,,,!MWMULTIPLE), MULTIPLE flag is set 
	to  server so that concatination of replies happen on	 
	client. Also, return code on mwreply() can now be either 
	MWFAIL, MWSUCCESS, or MWMORE. MWMORE in flag is depreciated.
