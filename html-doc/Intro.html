<h1>
<font size=+1>Exactly what is MidWay anyway?</font></h1> MidWay is
formally a <i>Service Request Broker</i> (SRB). MidWay is the first
Open Source Software implementation (at least know to me) of a very
old idea that originated on the Mainframe. The biggest of these is
CICS. On Unix <a href="tuxedo.html">Tuxedo&reg;</a> is dominant. SRB's
are for historical reasons known as <i>TP Monitors, </i>or
<i>Middleware</i>. The name MidWay is a pun on middleware. TP monitors
have a very advanced <a href="transactions.html">transaction</a>
concept, this is planned for MidWay in some future. 

 <p>Middleware is today a really bloated term, that are used on a
whole range of different technologies, I'm not going to elaborate on
this here.  There is an excellent book on most types of client/server
technologies called " <i>Client/Server Survival Guide</i>" by Orfali,
Harkey, and Edwards.  The differences between TP monitors and other
types of client/server technologies are explained in a lot of details
in the survival guide. I'm going to limit myself here to what MidWay
can do.&nbsp; You use MidWay or another middleware for any or all 
these reasons:
<ol>
<li>
Scalability</li>

<li>
Speed</li>

<li>
Throughput</li>

<li>
User need to operate on many databases, especially if they are of different
make.</li>

<li>
In 3-tier applications.</li>

<li>
Security</li>

<li>
27-7 applications.</li>
</ol>
In the heart of a SRB is the <i>request/response</i> model. Very much the
same as used in Web browsers (HTTP). Request/response are the reason that
mainframes could in the 70's handle a thousand concurrent users, while
even 90's Unix servers have trouble with a thousand concurrent telnet users.
The Web uses http specifically in order to achieve the needed scalability
to serve the world. The key is <a href="objects-functions.html#statelessness">statelessness
</a>.

<p>MidWay work by having servers processes that provides a <i>service</i>.
A server may provide many services, and many servers may provide the same
service. When a client call a service, it is load, and randomness that
determine which server that actually handle the request. The components
of a MidWay instance are shown here (only one server and one client.)

<br>
A service is mapped onto a subroutine or function. Unlike CORBA or
RPC, MidWay has no way to specify the data type of the parameters. In
fact, the only thing you may send to a service, and the only thing you
can send back from the service, is a buffer of <i>n</i> octets(bytes),
like a Perl scalar. I've very specific <a
href="presentation.html">reasons for not doing any data
presentation</a>.If you are familiar with the <a
href="osistack.html">OSI reference model,</a> MidWay is exclusively on
layer 5 the <i>session</i> layer. The encoding of the data is entirely
up to you. In many cases you would just pass a C struct, my
recommendation is to encode as URI fields (how html form data is
normally encode): <tt><font face="courier, courier
new">field1=value&amp;field2=value.</font></tt>

Another great way to format the query string is to use XML. <a
href="http://www.xml-rpc.org">XML-RPC </a> have made a spesification
on how to do this.  <p>In the current version of MidWay there are
limitations of how big <i>n </i>can be, but this is planned to be
removed. However, in order to maintain scalability, keep this as low
as possible. 1 Mb is becoming ridicules, you can usually keep this
below 10k.

<p>Another very important feature in a SRB is the ability to issue
multiple requests without waiting for the responses, as well as issue
request that shall not be replied to.

<p>3 tier applications are almost a given when using a SRB. The first
tier is the MidWay client, it provides the user interface. The second
tier is the MidWay server, and it is usually a database client. The
third tier is then the database it self. Normally the second and third
tier are sunning on the database server, while the first tier is
running os a workstation.

<p>Security is here almost implicit,and is provided by the second
tier.  If user authentication is required, MidWay can do it. (Not yet
implemented).  More importantly, only the operations programmed into
the second tier are possible, no matter what userid and password the
user may have on the database (third tier).

<p>The ability to stop and start servers dynamically make it easy to
make a backup or limited functionality server. When you take you
database of line for backup, upgrades and such, and the users need to
use at least a core set of operations you can put in an offline
service that do simplified processing. Almost all 24-7 has some sort
of backup/emergency processing. Just in case you miss out on the term
24-7, 24 hours 7 seven days a week availability.  Another term that is
coming up is "24 forever".
<h2>
<font size=+1>An Example</font></h2>
To do a fast example, in the client you would do:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<tt><font face="courier, courier new">#include
&lt;MidWay.h</font></tt>

<p><br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">  char * buffer;</font></tt>
<br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">int rc, apprcode, bufferlen,
flags = 0;</font></tt>
<br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">rc = </font></tt><a href="http://mwattach.3.html/">mwattach
</a><tt><font face="courier, courier new">("ipc:",
"test client", userid, password, flags); /* connect to a running instance
*/</font></tt>
<br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">/* do the request and get the
response immediately */</font></tt>
<br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">rc = </font></tt><a href="http://mwcall.3.html/">mwcall
</a><tt><font face="courier, courier new">("Service",
"Hello Server", 0, &amp;buffer, &amp;bufferlen, &amp;apprcode, flags);</font></tt></blockquote>

<p><br>Now in the server you need
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<div STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><tt><font face="courier, courier new">#include
&lt;MidWay.h</font></tt></div>

<p><br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">/* the service rutine, "application
logic" */</font></tt>
<br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">int servicehandler(mwsvcinfo
* si)</font></tt>
<br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">{</font></tt>
<br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">if (strcmp("si->data", "Hello
Server") == 0) {</font></tt>
<br><a href="http://mwreply.3.html/">mwreply</a><tt><font face="courier, courier new">("Hello
Client", 0, MWSUCCESS, appreturncode);</font></tt>
<br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">return MWSUCCESS;</font></tt>
<br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">}</font></tt>
<br><a href="http://mwreply.3.html/">mwreply</a><tt><font face="courier, courier new">("FAIL",
0, MWFAILURE, -1);</font></tt>
<br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">}</font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="courier, courier new">main()</font></tt>
<br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">{</font></tt>
<br><a href="http://mwattach.3.html/">mwattach</a><tt><font face="courier, courier new">("ipc://",
"test Server", NULL, NULL, MWSERVER); /* attach as a server, the MidWay
daemon, mwd, must run as the same uid.*/</font></tt>
<br><a href="http://mwprovide.3.html/">mwprovide</a><tt><font face="courier, courier new">("Service",
servicehandler flags = 0); /* provide the service "Service" and map it
to the C function servicehandler */</font></tt>
<br><a href="http://mwMainLoop.3.html/">mwMainLoop</a><tt><font face="courier, courier new">();
/* Wait eternally on request to my provided services. */</font></tt>
<br><tt><font face="courier, courier new">}</font></tt>
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
That's pretty much all you need to do, except to make sure that <a href="http://mwd.1.html/">mwd(1)
</a>is
running. Servers must run with the same userid as the <a href="http://mwd.1.html/">mwd(1)
</a>.
Note that the main() in the server is provided in the <a href="http://mwserver.1.html/">mwserver
</a>program.
<p>A note on the URI used here in <a href="http://mwattach.3.html/">mwattach
</a><tt><font face="courier, courier new">("ipc://",...).</font></tt>MidWay
uses system V ipc to communicate among the participants. For servers ipc
as protocol are the only one that is going to be legal for a long time,
probably forever. I'll add http for clients pretty soon, mostly because
http <i>is</i> a request/response protocol. I'll use Apache on the server
side, an Apache module is pretty high on my todo list. Both for clients
and for using MidWay services to generate HTML. However I must at some
point define a native MidWay protocol, foremost for gateways between two
running MidWay instances, but also for <a href="transactions.html">transactions
