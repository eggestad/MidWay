<H1><FONT SIZE=4>Conversations</FONT></H1> 

<P>I've stressed before that in order to be fast and scalable, you
need to be using request/response logic. R/R do have some limitations,
there are times where being state-full is necessary. The usual example
is the traversing through a database table. In SQL you've a cursor in
order to do this. In Embedded SQL you can only traverse one way, but
in ODBC both ways. Just consider when you make a search in a web
search engine, you get the results 10 at the time.</P>

<P>A part of the issue is that you should keep the data size in R/R
down. If you need to transfer a lot of data, you usually can begin to
present data to the user with only a partial transfer.</P>

<P>PS: I added the possibility to send multiple replies to a call in
an attempt to remedy this problem.

<P>Tuxedo solves this with a <i>conversation</i>. A conversation is
done by having conversational servers providing conversational
services. These are in a different name-space that R/R services. The
client gets one or, reserves of with a <TT><FONT FACE="courier,
courier new">tpconnect</FONT></TT>() call ,and releases it by
<TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">tpdisconnect</FONT> </TT>()
call. The conversation is done through calling <TT><FONT
FACE="courier, courier new">tpsend </FONT></TT>() and <TT><FONT
FACE="courier, courier new">tpread</FONT> </TT>() on both sides. An
import limitation in Tuxedo is that conversations are half duplex,
only one side may do a <TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">tpsend
</FONT></TT>() at a time, and the connection is turned with a flag on
<TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">tpsend</FONT></TT>().</P>

<p>It quite possible that Tuxedo got is conversation concept from
CPI-C, or that they specifically chose to be CPI-C 
compatible. CPI-C is the programming API for SNA APPC. APPC is the <a
href="osistack.html">session layer</a> in SNA. In CPI-C you do an
allocate, send, receive, and deallocate in order to do a
(mw)call. This simple spell of 4 calls are what is normally done in
all CPI-C programs, but the API clearly allows keeping a dialog
going. (I must admit that CPI-C is second hand information to me,
I've never used CPI-C, only read the API doc.) I've interview a couple of
seasoned CICS programmers for this info.
</p>

<P>Personally I would prefer to have a normal socket between the
server and the client. Partly for having a full duplex connection,
partly because I love the <TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier
new">select</FONT></TT>(2) call. Another reason is for things like TCL
that has the possibility to wait for an event either from the user
(key-press or mouse-input) or data on a socket at the same time.
</P>

<P>I've barely begun writing code in MidWay for socket based
conversations, but I'm holding it a bit off since there are issues on
how this should be handled when having a gateway between two MidWay
instances, and through FireWalls. (See <A
HREF="roadahead.html">Road-Map</A>)</P>

<p>Another tempting thing to do is to make an ORB. An ORB in the
MidWay fashion would be to call methods in the mwcall() way. No data
types, and objects could dynamically add and remove methods on
themselves.  We would have to add a mwnew() or mwbind() in order to
bind or create objects. I need to give this some thought. hmmm, neat
idea...
</p>

<P>An advantage in the way Tuxedo does it in the . It goes back to the
number of TCP connections. Tuxedo most likely multiplexes the conversations on
the connection already established.
</P>

<P>However, you can your self implement a socket based conversation. If you
read <A HREF="#mwreply.3.html">mwreply</A>() you will notice that the service
routine do not return (the macro mwreturn() do). You can in your service
routine create a socket, bind it and listen, then return the address  of the
socket to the client thru mwreply(). Then you do an accept in the service
routine. Just note  that until your service routine do perform a normal C
return, your server are busy. <BR>
