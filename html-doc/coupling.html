<P><FONT FACE="times, serif">MidWay and it's other TP monitor cousins
are designed foremost for speed and scaleability, however they do
have a place in loosly coupled programs. In order to define what I
mean by &quot;loosely coupled&quot; it can be look at degrees of
coupling. The most tigthly coupled program are assembly programs with
no OS, running straight on the CPU. No memory protection, or defined
interfaces. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="times, serif">However consider this rule: <B><U>The
more disjoint the programmers are the smaller and simpler the
interfaces must be</U></B>. Or to make a collorary to Murphy's law,
Any API description that may be misunderstood or misused, <I>will</I>.
(Ask Microosoft API developers that, especially about the Windows 3.5
to 3.51 upgrade.) </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="times, serif">It is not enough to define data types in
an interface, since specific values in one may change the legal
values in another. Consider printf(3), where even the first argument
changes the number of required arguments, not to mention their types.
See discussion of OSI layers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="times, serif">Now I',m gonna say something that is
going to be a bit controversial: <B><U>An object oriented interface
is by definition more complex than a functional one.</U></B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="times, serif">Consider Corba, in the heart
of Corba you have a IDL (Interface Definition Language). You can't
even compile you program without having defined it's interfaces. If
other objects you use changes their interfaces, you must recompile.
The  later will normally hold true for MidWay applicatios as well,
but you can exchange data encoded like web browsers encode HTML forms
data: <B><FONT FACE="courier, monospace">fieldname1=value&amp;fieldname2=value</FONT></B>
etc. Then your server may not even know about all the arguents sent
it, nor care about them. It allows you to have a much less rigid
regime in maintaining versions of all your components. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="times, serif">BTW: I'm not saying that
object orientation of your programs is wrong, nor that Corba and it's
likes are wrong, quite the contrary,  I'm just saying that they are
better suited for more tightly coupled systems.</FONT></P>
