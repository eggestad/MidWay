<H1>Loose and tight coupled programs.</H1>

<P>MidWay and it's other TP monitor cousins are designed foremost for
speed and scaleability, however they do have a place in loosly coupled
programs. In order to define what I mean by &quot;loosely
coupled&quot; it can be look at degrees of coupling. The most tigthly
coupled program are assembly programs with no OS, running straight on
the CPU. No memory protection, or defined interfaces.
</P>

<P>However consider this rule: <B><U>The more disjoint the programmers
are the smaller and simpler the interfaces must be</U></B>. Or to make
a collorary to Murphy's law; Any API description that may be
misunderstood or misused, <i>will</i>.  (Ask Microosoft API developers
that, especially about the Windows 3.5 to 3.51 upgrade.)
</P>

<h2>IDL</h2>
<P>It is not enough to define data types in
an interface, since specific values in one may change the legal
values in another. Consider printf(3), where even the first argument
changes the number of required arguments, not to mention their types.
See discussion of OSI layers.</P>

<P>Now I',m gonna say something that is
going to be a bit controversial: <B><U>An object oriented interface
is by definition more complex than a functional one.</U></B></P>

<P> Consider Corba, in the heart
of Corba you have a IDL (Interface Definition Language). You can't
even compile you program without having defined it's interfaces. If
other objects you use changes their interfaces, you must recompile.
The  later will normally hold true for MidWay applicatios as well,
but you can exchange data encoded like web browsers encode HTML forms
data: <B><FONT FACE="courier, monospace">fieldname1=value&amp;fieldname2=value</FONT></B>
etc. Then your server may not even know about all the arguents sent
it, nor care about them. It allows you to have a much less rigid
regime in maintaining versions of all your components. 
</P>

<P>BTW: I'm not saying that object orientation of your programs is
wrong, nor that Corba and it's likes are wrong, quite the contrary,
I'm just saying that they are better suited for more tightly coupled
systems.</P>

<P>See also discussion on problems with <A
HREF="objects-functions.html#forking">forking</A>.
</P>

<h2>Robustness</h2> In order to be robust we must have a plan for what
happen when things go wrong. In this world of having Inter Program
Communication, one program may disappear for some reason. It may do
down on command, intentionally or not, it may core dump, or its host
may crash or be subject to something as mundane as a power failure.

<p>Consider what happens when your application shoudl do if it was in
the middle of talking to an object, when it just dissapeared. It is
the very nature with a SRB that you don't know which server handling
your request are, or where it is. If one server failes, there may be
backup servers somewhere else, but you can't switch to a backup object
on the fly because it will not have the same state.

This is why SRBs are better suited for 24x7 systems and
interapplication communication. ORBs are better suited for making
really large applications.
