<H1>Scalability through funneling</H1>

<P>MidWay provide the ability to have many more attached clients than
there are servers, thus the number of users and sessions on the third
tier (the database usually). We keep the use of resources (RAM most
importantly) on the database server down to the absolute minimum.</P>

<P>RAM aside, there are limits to how many processes and sockets an OS
can handle effectively. The number of processes are discussed in the
<A HREF="objects-function.html">next section</A>. Here we discuss a
bit the problem with TCP sessions and sockets.
</P>

<H2>Upper limits of number of sockets/connections.</H2> 

<P>Remember that when an operating system receive a TCP or UDP packet,
it must find the proper queue to put the payload on. The proper queue
is identified with the following key:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><div STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><I><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">remote
ip adr + remote port + local port + local ip adr</FONT></TT></I></div >
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In IPv4 the key is <TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">4 + 2 + 2
+ 4 = 12 bytes </FONT></TT>, and will in IPv6 increase to <TT><FONT
FACE="courier, courier new">16 + 2 + 2 + 16 = 36 bytes</FONT></TT>. On
a 32 bit machine it requires 10 load and 10 compare instruction for
every socket. OS's do a sequential search through the socket table in
the kernel, at least Linux do. If we have a 1 000 000 connections it
is on average 500000 key tests which is 10 000 000 instructions. A top
of the line CPU today can to 1 000 000 000 instructions a second, and
we have burnt off all available CPU resource with 100 packets a
second. Most servers today still have only a megabyte or two in L2
cache, and we need 36 MBytes just to hold the socket table. Needless
to say, you get a storm of cache misses, and you would get a 10 fold
degradation of performance.
</P>

<p> The important thing to remember is that the work needed to process
all packets coming into a machine per second is 

<p align=center><i>W = p * n</i></p>
where <i>p</i> is the number of packet and <i>n</i> is the number
of sockets. If there is one user per socket then we have a
relationship between <i>p</i> and <i>n</i>. <i>p = n*r</i>, where <i>r</i>
is the rate of packets each user generate. This leave us with 

<p align=center><i>W = n^2*r</i> or <i> O(n^2)</i></p>

<p>It is the square here that gives us a particular problem, and why
the limit of max sockets don't increase all that much over time. Given
a 1Gips CPU above, and we say that we can't use more than 1% of CPU in
processing packets, we have 20 instruction per packet, and we on
average have to test 1/2 of the sockets.  <p align=center><i>1000 000
000 / 100 = 20 * 1/2 * n*2</i></p> <p align=center><i> n =
1000</i></p>

<p>A hard limit of 1000 sockets, or with 1:1 with sockets and users,
1000 users.  The Web (http) remedies this by connecting and
disconnecting for every request.  There is one problem that remain,
latency on the net is often quite high. Try some ping around locally
and on other continents. Round trip over my ISDN line to my ISP gives
a round trip time of 30ms.  To the US I get usually a round trip of
200ms.  The thing is that due to the TCP three-way handshake on connect
and the exchange of the disconnect packages, the socket must exist for
two round trips. Considering that a well designed MidWay service
should complete in 10ms, you have a problem.  (NB: Suddenly the speed
on the users access line to the Internet becomes <i>your</i>
problem!)  Fortunately, Linux at least only test for connections in
ESTABLISHED state, effectively divides the problem by 3 (or at least 2),
but /3 still doesn't solve the O(n^2) problem, nor the RAM requirement
for holding the socket table.

<p>One remedy to this problem is <i>Transactional</i> TCP, T/TCP RFC
1644.  T/TCP bypasses the three-way handshake, and the TIME_WAIT
state. T/TCP has some security issues, I picked up a <a
href="ttcp-sec.txt">draft RFC</a> on the issue.  T/TCP doesn't either
solve the O(n^2) problem, but funneling does. </p>

<P>The RAM problem get quite a bit worse. A socket needs queues for
storing data being send and received. On Unix these are two 16 kBytes
buffers, or 32 kB for every socket. With 10000 sockets you need 320
MB of buffer space, and we haven't even done any work outside the
kernel yet. Now you can start to consider kernel tables for open
files, process tables, the amount to work is it to just schedule 10000
processes, etc.</P>

<P>In the literature, this is the main argument for using a SRB. A
machine can handle 500 sockets, 1000 processes, and 1000 Mbytes of
VM. It will go into thrashing with 10000 sockets, 20000 processes,
and 20 GB of VM. When using an SRB, the optimal numbers are in the
area of 50 sockets, 100 processes and 100 Mbytes of RAM. More
importantly: you get to use the RAM for what it should be used for, DB
cache!</P>

<P>If you look at Apache it has in its config <I>min</I>
<I>servers</I>, and <I>max servers</I>. Apache will fork <I>n</I>
copies of itself to handle all the incoming requests, with <TT><FONT
FACE="courier, courier new">min &lt; n &lt; max</FONT></TT>. If Apache
gets more requests than max, they are queued in the TCP/IP stack,
until a server is ready to process. MidWay is just more flexible, and
more general. Apache don't solve the <A
