<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>It is this statelessness that makes it
scalable. The CORBA camp has come to the conclusion that while CORBA
does what it was intended to do, it scales poorly. A function passing
TP monitor is the tested and tried, it scales, and since html/CGI is
also stateless, it integrates better to web solutions. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Another side of the story is that I do not
believe in reusable objects. The reason is stated in Eggestad law of
reusable code: &quot;The reusability of code is inversely
proportional to the code complexity.&quot; Since objects are more
complex than functions, they are less reusable. </FONT>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Another problem with communication between
objects are their need for increased intercommunication. If you
trying to run your applikcation over a WAN, the latecy will kill you.

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Always keep in mind that the principle
design criteria for MidWay is speed and throughput. </FONT>
