<h1>MidWay</h1>

<P>Midway fits in the larger picture as an
implementation of the session layer in the OSI presentation model.</P>

</P>

<P>It is this statelessness that makes it scalable. The CORBA camp has
come to the conclusion that while CORBA does what it was intended to
do, it scales poorly. A function passing TP monitor is the tested and
tried, it scales, and since html/CGI is also stateless, it integrates
better to web solutions.
</P>

<P>Another side of the story is that I do not believe in reusable
objects. The reason is stated in Eggestad law of reusable code:
&quot;The reusability of code is inversely proportional to the code
complexity.&quot; Since objects are more complex than functions, they
are less reusable.
</P>

<P>Another problem with communication between objects are their need
for increased intercommunication. If you trying to run your
application over a WAN, the latency may kill you unless
<it>really</it> you know what you're doing.
</P>

<P>Always keep in mind that the principle design criteria for MidWay
is speed and throughput.
