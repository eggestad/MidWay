<h1>The Data Presentation issue</h1>
<P>If you're unfamiliar with the term Presentation layer see
discussion on <A HREF="osistack.html">the OSI reference mode</A>l.
The short version is that in the OSI model, you've a specific
software layer that handle how data are to be presented. HTML is one
example of a data presentation standard. ASN.1 is another. In data
presentation you deal with issues like, how is an INTEGER encode.
Different machines may be MSB (Most Significant Bit First) or LSB
(Least). The equivalent of deciding if your machine writes from left
to right, or right to left. Are INTEGER unsigned, or signed, if
signed are negative numbers encoded in signed-magnitude, one's
compliment, or two's compliment. Are INTERGERs 16 bit, 32 bit, 64
bit, 36 bit? While all machines designs since the mini machines are 8
bit based, mainframes where originally 6 bit. I believe that IBM 390
machines are 9 bit based, and data width are 36 bit. 
</P>

<P>This is part of the reason IBM mainframes use EBCDIC character set
(9 bit) while everyone else are in the ASCII world. ASCII is actually
7 bit, How the upper half of the 8bit byte (octet) are be used was
chaos until ISO-8859-1 came along and defined an 8bit character set
for all countries using the Latin alphabet as base. Prior to that a
number of 8bit charset was proposed. MicroSoft used the codepage
scheme that resulted in different codepages for every language. HP
has promoted roman8 forever, even today their printers come with a
factory setting of roman8 and not 8859-1 Latin-1 as default charset.
The HP Unix HP-UX has the same peculiarity. The charset story gets
better with multi-octet characters. 16Bit chars was proposed for a
while, but we seem to end with variable length characters, n octets. 
</P>

<P>My first language happens to be Norwegian, and Norwegian has three
extra characters from English: &AElig;&Oslash;&Aring; (upper) &aelig;&oslash;&aring;
(lower). In strict seven bit machines, historic now, the ASCII values
for {|} was used for the lower chars and [\] for the upper. Consider
how cool it was to program C with your terminal and printer set up
this way, not to mention that your keyboard no longer had &quot;{[]}\|&quot;!
MicroSoft codepage PC850, roman8 and ISO 8859 Latin-1 places these
char in the upper 7bit, but of course in different placed, and
lexically on the wrong order. Suddenly you discover that sorting
places &aring; before &oslash;, think about a sort routine that sort
b before a. Setting up OS's databases, etc. with the right LANG, LC_
and NLS variables become an art form by itself. 
</P>

<P>So far I just talked about integers and characters, now consider
that SQL databases usually define data types that don't exist in many
programing languages. DECIMAL for example. It is defined in COBOL,
but not many other. C terminates strings with a NULL char, while many
other languages has an integer associated with the string to specify
length, Perl does this for example. 
</P>

<P>Data encoding is pretty much a field of science all by itself. 
There has been many attempt to find general solutions to this
problem. ASN.1 is one, the OSI had quite a few chapters on this, and
OSI used this as the main critique of TCP/IP. TCP/IP only specify
that in TCP you have a stream of octets, and in UDP, a block of
octets. IP only make sure that MSB and LSB of each octet are handled
correctly. Despite attempt, a true general way to to datatype
encoding has ever succeeded. I believe that TCP/IP succeeded to
become a standard not <U>despite</U> the lack of data presentation,
but <U><I>because</I></U>
the lack of one. Same thing with the popularity of Perl, TCL/TK,
Pyton, and PHP that has only one atomic data type, the scalar (really
strings). HTML too has only strings, and love and behold, the world
embraced it. 
</P>

<p>The cost difference of translation an integer to a string and back
instead of a propper binary format drown the second you you start
accessing disk. It has been traditionally a rarety if a service
handler don't perform some kind of disk operation.  The very idea
behind a SRB calls for coarse grain parallellism, ask for all that
needs to be done in one call.
</p>

<P>Data presentation don't stop with encoding of specific data types,
but in function passing, you may want to define the parameters. In RPC
you generate stubs, and in CORBA you've got an <I>IDL</I> (Interface
Description Language). The problem with IDL's are that changes to the
interface tend to require recompilation of all clients and server
<I>simultaneously</I>.  If you have a 1000 MidWay clients, replacing
them all are no small task. I've participated in a couple of projects
where changes on this scale has been necessary, and a couple where we
used Tuxedo, and either replaced the servers with new version that
could handle old and new clients, or added new servers that very used
for the new clients. Phased migration are the key. Remember that in
24-7 systems all changes must be reversible.
</P>

<P>Another issue is that while some programming languages provide
ranging on data, particular well in Pascal, and enums in C, it is
still not enough. A legal range on a parameter in a function or
method, may (actually usually do) change depending on the value in
other parameters. A very typical example is the printf(3) function.</P>

<P>When dealing with formats to use among MidWay participants, I'll
recommend to copy the http scheme. First of all, specifying a MIME
type. MIME are  perhaps one of the more ingenious schemes to do data
presentation. In this way the data passed in an service call should
be prefix with for example &quot;Content-type: text/html\n\n&quot; or
&quot;Content-type: application/octet-stream\n\n&quot;. See
<A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types">http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types</A>,
RFC2616 (HTTP 1.1) and RFC 2388 (multipart/form-data). Most Web forms
are encoded with MIME type: application/x-url-encoded which has the
familiar
<FONT SIZE=3><tt>name=Xavier+Xantico&amp;verdict=Yes&amp;colour=Blue&amp;happy=sad&amp;Utf%F6r=Send
</tt></FONT>format. This is actually a FML without the data types.
The really nice part is that a service may use only a few fields
before passing it on to another service. I'm considering a separate
library for manipulating url-encoded buffers more gracefully. Just
keep in mind that it will have nothing to do with MidWay. MidWay is
strictly <A HREF="osi-stack.html">Session Layer</A>. 
</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="tuxedo.html">Tuxedo</A> do mess with data
presentation, while MidWay simply passes octet strings, Tuxedo has
types buffers. One of the more interesting types are <I>FML</I>
(Field Manipulation Language). In the way Tuxedo does it, it requires
defining the FML in a separate file, and a FML IDL compiler. The
reason being that each Filed in the FML has a data type (integer,
float, string etc.) Another reason is that Tuxedo provides data
dependent routing, thus selecting different servers depending on
values in the FML buffer. Just keep in mind what I said above, if you
want this, a new API should be created on top of MidWay's API. 
</P>

<p>I did consider adding a MIME parameter to mwcall(), but I don't
really see what MidWay need ths information for.
</p>

In the end of the day the only form of data that is really language 
independent is an octet string.
