<P><FONT SIZE=3>The term transaction monitor stems from the earlier
days since this technology was developed on mainframes to do vast
number of transactions per seconds. The most famous of these are
CICS. Since it was seemingly pointless to have a mainframe without a
database there was a close integration between the transaction
monitor and the database. Once simple since there was no many options
when it came to selection a database. However the functionality was
to have a database transaction span across several services. The
function passing was just a mean to achieve this.</FONT> 
</P>
<P>The concept of transactions used here is exactly the same as used
in databases. A transaction is a group or set of work that are
atomic, either it all succeed or it all never happened.</P>
<P>SRB's are sometimes referred to as Transaction Processing Monitors
or just TP monitors. The &quot;Transaction&quot; part stems from
three API calls, that do a transaction  begin, abort, or commit.
Every thing between the begin and commit are atomic. This is exactly
the same as begin, abort and commit on SQL. Transaction is by RDBMS
(Database monitors) to be a fairly advanced concepts. Commercial
level RDBMS's has such as Oracle, Sybase, DB2, etc do for course have
it. Postgres has it, while MySQL, and mSQL do not. For a RDBMS or
another resource to cooperate with a TP monitor, it has to support
two-phase commits. TP monitors tend to have a Transaction monitor
that know about all the transaction capable resources and coordinate
transactions among them. Tuxedo and CICS for examples can do this. TP
monitors originated on the mainframe, and IBM had an easy time since
they made both CICS, DB2, and the OS with file system. The makers of
Tuxedo, had a tougher time and had to make an open interface
standard. X-Open picked it up and it is called the XA interface. It
is now a ISO standard. (Posix begun and abandoned work on a standard
of its own. POSIX.11) In the X-Open world  the API is tx_begin()
tx_abort() and tx_commit(). They are pretty much identical to tuxedos
tp_begin() tp_abort(), and tp_commit(). XA defines that the TP
monitor must have a transaction monitor, and for each XA capable
resource a resource monitor.

here means any resource such as RDBMS, file system, persistent queue,
etc. 
</P>
<P>Corba by the way defines an OTB (Object Transaction Broker). I've
never checked out if the Linux version of Oracle support XA, but
Oracle do support XA , so it seem a safe bet. The Linux version of
Oracle seem pretty complete. THis is a rather advanced feature, and
since I'm not really a DB person I'll exclude myself in the
implementation of anything XA'ish in MidWay.
