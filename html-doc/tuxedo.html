<h1>Tuxedo</h1>

<P>Tuxedo is a commercial software currently owned by BEA systems
<A HREF="http://www.bea.com/">http://www.bea.com</A>. It was
originally started by AT&amp;T (Bell labs), later bought by Novell,
and later bought by BEA. Tuxedo was originally called TUX, an
abbreviation for Transaction UniX. It is apart for MidWay, the only
TP monitor available on Linux, as far as I know. 
</P>

<P>Tuxedo is the only TP monitor I've actually written code with. 
MidWay has therefore a lot of its ancestry in Tuxedo, there are many
similarities between the API, and some very important differences.
Most notably the fact that the <A HREF="presentation.html">data
buffers</A> are types in Tuxedo while only octet strings in MidWay. 
</P>

<P>In addition to the request/response calls, Tuxedo has <A
HREF="conversations.html">conversational</A> services, event
notification, queues, and full <A
HREF="transactions.html">transaction</A> support. All these are
something MidWay should have. However I've not yet decided how these
functionalites should be designed in MidWay.  Transactions are
something I'll probably never begin to mess with.  Time will show. An
important feature in Tuxedo is the administration of server
processes. In fact, unlike MidWay it is impossible in Tuxedo to start
a server without adding it to the configuration file. Creating an
instance of Tuxedo is much more complex than getting a MidWay instance
up and running. Simplicity is one major design goal of MidWay.</P>

<P>I'm also very unhappy with the use of  the TCP/IP protocols in
Tuxedo. MidWay will work quite a bit different.</P>

<P>Tuxedo is directed much more towards legacy software, such as
having SNA gateways. It also have native bindings for C and COBOL
only. BEA has added Java in various ways lately. BEA also built a
product called web logic that uses Java Servlets to generate HTML,
and that can call tuxedo services, among other things. <BR>Language
Bindings for MidWay is primary C, but I will ASAP add perl, tcl,
pyton, php, and java.</P>

<P>Keep in mind that Tuxedo is old, and well evolved, with all its
pros and cons. In particular, I've tried to write the current MidWay
code as thread ready as possible. Tuxedo will have a much harder time in
order to be thread safe.</P>

<P>For those unfamiliar with Tuxedo, BEA was giving out evaluation
copies for free on Lunix, they might still be.
