(*) Shutdown
I'm not very happy with the shutdown procedure. Servers are commanded down by 
removing their message queue. This don't work with clients, 
a) they may run as another user,
b) their're not in blocking wain on the queue usually. (Client gateways will! Maybe
IPC clients really should be depreciated, unless a server.)
Clients will not release IPC shm segments anyway, kernel fix on shmctl() critical.

In servers added a flag param to _mw_send_detach() in order to send a force flag.
mwd do understand the flag and do not ack it. This is non negotiable by the server, 
not a request. But it messes up the neatness of _mw_*detach() functions to mess 
with a force flag.

Tried a signal approach to giving a shutdown command, didn't like that either, 
didn't like the consept of doing a msgrcv() from a signal handler. 

A untried method is to send a message to command a shutdown, but it don't handle
server crashes, (i.e. core dumps).
